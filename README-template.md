```html
<div class="right-column">
    <h4>Summary</h4> <br>
    <div class="rating" style="background-color: #FF8989;">Reaction 65/100</div>
    <div class="rating" style="background-color: #FFC689;">Memory 80/100</div>
    <div class="rating" style="background-color: #AAFF89;">Verbal 92/100</div>
    <div class="rating" style="background-color: #89E4FF;">Visual 70/100</div> <br>
    <button type="submit">continue</button>
  </div>
```
```css
 .rating:nth-child(1) {
      background-color: #FF8989;
    }

    .rating:nth-child(2) {
      background-color: #FFC689;
    }

    .rating:nth-child(3) {
      background-color: #AAFF89;
    }

    .rating:nth-child(4) {
      background-color: #89E4FF;
    }
```
```js
<script>
      // Calculate average rating
      const reactionRating = 65;
      const memoryRating = 80;
      const verbalRating = 90;
      const visualRating = 75;
      const totalRatings = 4;
      const averageRating = (reactionRating + memoryRating + verbalRating + visualRating) / totalRatings;

      // Update average rating in the circle
      const averageCircle = document.getElementById('average-circle');
      averageCircle.textContent = Math.round(averageRating);
    </script>

```



### Continued development

In future projects, I plan to continue focusing on responsive design and accessibility. I also plan to explore more advanced CSS techniques, such as CSS animations and custom properties. I also plan to add icons in CSS.
